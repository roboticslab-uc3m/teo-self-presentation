presentation_01 "Hi. My name is TEO. I am a humanoid robot designed in the University Carlos Tercero of Madrid. I am 10 years old. My size is 1 70 meters and my weight is 60 kilograms."
presentation_02 "My purpose, is to enable our researchers, to reach new achievements and discoveries, within the robotics area."
composition_01 "I am mainly built, of aluminum, plastic and carbon fiber."
composition_02 "I have 28 degrees, of freedom, that allow me to move freely, being able to do, such human tasks as walking, identifying and manipulating objects, doing household chores, ironing, serving as a waiter, etc."
composition_03 "In my head, I have implemented two cameras, with which, I can detect objects, and human faces. Also, I can detect their distance and depth."
composition_04 "As you can see, I have three computers, in my chest, each dedicated to a different task."
composition_05_01 "The computer on my right, serves me, to capture and process the data collected from my sensors."
composition_05_02 "While, the computer on my left, is dedicated, to the tasks of, manipulation and locomotion. It is the computer that plans and gives life to each of my movements"
composition_05_03 "The computer that is located, just at the top, is dedicated to the processing of vision. In this way, each computer, is dedicated to processing a part of the task that I will perform."
composition_06 "Both of them, the manipulation computer, and the locomotion computer, are connected to a communication network called, can bus, which sends all the motion commands to each of my motors."
composition_07 "I also have movement, inertial, and force sensors, that allow me to detect the weight, and pressure exerted on my joints. These sensors allow, for example, to stay in balance, while walking or standing up."
purpose_01 "All the components that make up everything I am, as well as the programs that allow me to perform all these tasks, have been developed by teachers and students from this university. The main mission is to discover and advance together in the field of robotics."
purpose_02 "For now, I am only a prototype, dedicated to research, so, I can not be sold in any store. Also, my price would be too expensive to be bought."
ending_01 "These, is the end of my presentation. I hope you liked it, and if you want, you can take a picture with me. Nice to meet you."
