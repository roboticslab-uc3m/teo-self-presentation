## Installation

Installation instructions for installing from source can be found [here](doc/teo-self-presentation-install.md).

## Usage

Refer to the [demo procedure guide](https://robots.uc3m.es/teo-developer-manual/demo-procedure.html) for the initial robot setup steps.

Once installed, run `yarpmanager` and look for the language version of the launcher XML file you are most interested in (teo-self-presentation_*language*.xml). If not present, you can manually add this application by means of the "Open File" or "Import Folder" buttons.

Double click on the app and press "Run all", await until all modules have successfully loaded. Then, press "Connect all". The robot should start moving and speaking.
